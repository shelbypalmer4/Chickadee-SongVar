## This repository houses the data and code used for my final project in Statistical Ecology (FA23) at the University of Florida.  
  
**All of the raw data used for this project were collected during my master's thesis work at Missouri State University.**  
  
* `SPPUA_song_level_measurements_final.csv` is a dataset of acoustic measurements extracted from recordings of 10 individuals from a Black-capped chickadee/Carolina chickadee hybrid zone population.  
  
* `All_Data_1.csv` is a file used to obtain genotype data for individuals.  
  
* `StatEco-FinalPoster-Code.R` is the R code for analyses.  
  
* The code used to make the figures on the poster is in a separate script that I would be glad to upload upon request.
